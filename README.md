# 3D Filament Label Generator

Do note that this code was mainly created by AI and I did only fix what was broken and instructed the AI a bit. The code is probably shit but for such a small project this was a quick and working solution.

This project was created to solve a very practical problem: keeping track of a large and growing collection of 3D printing filaments.

I print a lot of **filament swatches** to show colors and material properties. Friends can then look through these swatches and choose a color they like for their prints. With many different **brands**, **materials**, and **color names**, it quickly becomes impossible to remember which filament is which.

This tool generates **uniform, print-accurate labels** that can be attached to filament swatches, making the collection easy to understand and use. I use this model for my swatches: https://makerworld.com/en/models/639266-bambu-lab-filament-swatch-with-12x22r2-label?from=search#profileId-565048
